/*************************** *******************************
* There is a large pile of socks that must be paired by    *
* color. Given an array of integers representing the       *
* color of each sock, determine how many pairs of socks    *
* with matching colors there are.                          *
*                                                          *
* Example:                                                 *
* n = 7                                                    *
* ar = [1,2,1,2,1,3,2]                                     *
*                                                          *
* There is one pair of color 1, and one of color 3.        * 
* There are three odd socks left, one of each color.       *
* The numbers of pairs is 2.                               *
*                                                          *
* Complete the sockMerchant function:                      *
* sockMerchant has the following parameter(s):             *
* int n: the number of socks in the pile                   *
* int ar[n]: the colors of each sock.                      *
