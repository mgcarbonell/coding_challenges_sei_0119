# There is a room in a temple in Hanoi with three time worn     #
# poles. According to an ancient Buddhist prophecy, a Buddhist  #
# monk must move 64 golden discs from one pole to the next.     #
# When the monk finishes, the world will end.                   #
                                                                #
# Here are the rules:                                           #
# 1. Only one disk can be moved at one time.                    #
# 2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one       #
#     of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack      #
#     or on an empty pole.                                      # 
# 3. No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.     #
